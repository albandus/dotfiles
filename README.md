dotfiles
========

- Install script valid only for Linux, very basic, could be done manually,
  mostly written as a reminder. For mac, MUST be done manually adapting command
  as needed.
- Alacritty / Tmux: mac version done by copying linux version and adapting some
  values. No tries to make it dynamic / auto.
- Grep "brew" on dotfiles for some additional instructions
